Known Problems
==============

OpenAI
^^^^^^

At the time of version 0.5.4 release, only people with a $1 or more successful payment on their account have access to the GPT-4 model. According to OpenAI, that should change soon.

If you try to use the GPT-4 model without access you currently get a 404 error message which is a bit confusing.
