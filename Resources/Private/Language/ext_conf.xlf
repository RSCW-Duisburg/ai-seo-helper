                <source>OpenAI Temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.</source>

                <source>Use always URL for requests: With this option you can use the corresponding URL of the page for all analyses. As a result, you have to use fewer tokens to carry out your corresponding analyses. IMPORTANT: The page must be publicly accessible (hidden pages fail and pages in a local environment lead to poor results)</source>

            <trans-unit id="maxAllowedCharacters" resname="maxAllowedCharacters">
                <source>Maximum characters per request: Here you can additionally limit the maximum number of allowed characters. By default, OpenAI allows a maximum of 4096 tokens per request, which corresponds to around 16000 to 16350 characters (in English). Special characters are "more expensive" than normal characters, which means that a token can sometimes be less than 4 characters.
